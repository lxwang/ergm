\title{Goodreau's four node network as a ``network" object}
\description{
  This is an example thought of by Steve Goodreau. It is a directed
  network of four nodes and five ties stored as a \code{\link[network]{network}} object.

  It is interesting because the maximum likelihood estimator of the 
  model with out degree 3 in it exists, but the maximum psuedolikelihood
  estimator does not.
